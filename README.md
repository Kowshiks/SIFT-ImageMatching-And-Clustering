# SIFT-ImageMatching-And-Clustering

When I ran SIFT on an image, SIFT will identify some set of maybe 1000 corner points in an image. And for each of those corner points it will give 128 dimensional mathematical vector that is supposed to capture, supposed to be a representation of of the local image content around that corner. And it supposed to do this in an invariant way such that we will get the same descriptor even after image rotation, perspective change or illumination change.

Iâ€™ll be using ORB in python here. And perform Image matching.
